	<h2> The reason people named steven are the worst type of people are when thye stay up days on end with no sleep to just a dumb video game that cant be fun to them at this point for example sven has made 5 or more charcters on lost ark and also has 130ish hours on a game that came out in the us little under 2 weeks and with a little math we will find out how much he is sleeping the last two weeks and with elden ring just about 30 hours away from release this will be intresting </h2>
	
	
	<h2> steven has 113 hours on lost ark </h2>
	<h2> 12 days this game has been out so 12x24=288 hours  </h2>
	<h2> 288-113=175 lets asume he is getting a normal persons 8 hours of sleep but this would be a massive lie man really stays up for 24 hours to play this game and sleeps for like 14 hours its dumb but for simpliesty lets use 8 hours of sleep </h2>
	<h2> 8x12=96 hours of sleep total in these 12 days this isnt fully right as he went to sleep at like 9 adn is still asleep its 10 30 am....... but for simplisty 8 hours like a normal person </h2>\
	<h2> 175-96=79 hours of other activites now we can find the percent of how much of his life he has invested into a game and sleeping </h2> 
	<h2> ok so now the fun part 113/288=.39 so 39% of his time just in a game that came out 12 days ago </h2>
	<h2> 96/288=.33 33%of this time is in sleep </h2>
	<h2> 39+33=72% of his last 12 days invested into a game and sleep and this is being nice i added today the 23 inot this when he hasnt even started his day yet so these numbers are a little nicer then what they should be </h2>
